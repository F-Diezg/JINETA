# Jineta — Design Document

> Living document. Update it at the end of each phase. It lives in the repo and in

> Section 8 says how Claude and the author work together.

## 1. What Jineta is

A **multi-agent air-defence simulator**: incoming aerial threats (one-way attack
drones, slow cruise missiles, hostile drones) versus a group of interceptor drones
that coordinate to neutralise them, over **real terrain**, with **realistic 6-DOF
physics**.

The goal is to **compare coordination strategies** (target assignment, centralised
vs. distributed command, robustness to comms loss or losing an interceptor) through
Monte Carlo analysis.

Name: *jineta* = historical Spanish light cavalry — small, agile units that
coordinated hit-and-run attacks. Team brand: **Ibero**.

Author: 3rd-year aerospace engineering student. First large software project, so
code should be clear and every concept explained before it is used.

## 2. Environment

- OS: Windows (two machines: laptop + desktop, synced via GitHub)
- Python **3.13** in a `.venv` virtual environment
- Editor: VS Code (extensions: Python, Pylance, Ruff, GitLens)
- Dependencies: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pyyaml`, `matplotlib`, `pytest`, `ruff`
  (pinned in `requirements.txt`)
- Run tests from repo root: `pytest -v`
- `pyproject.toml` configures pytest (`testpaths`) and ruff (line length 88, rules
  E, F, I, UP, B, RUF). VS Code's Ruff extension reads it, so the editor shows the
  same warnings as `ruff check .`
- Run examples from repo root: `python -m examples.<name>`
- Save all open files (Ctrl+S) before running tests: pytest runs what is on disk.
- Before every commit run `ruff format .` (not only `--check`): it adds the final
  newline and fixes blank lines that are easy to lose when pasting code. In VS
  Code, "Files: Insert Final Newline" and format-on-save with the Ruff formatter
  do the same automatically.
- The full test run takes ~20 s: the closed-loop control tests simulate up to 30 s
  of flight each.
- Regenerate dependencies as UTF-8 (PowerShell's `>` writes UTF-16):
  `pip freeze | Out-File -Encoding utf8 requirements.txt`

## 3. Conventions

- **Code in English** (names, comments, docstrings). Module names are themed.
- **Units: SI everywhere** (m, s, kg, rad, N). Degrees only at input/output edges.
- **Reference frame: NED** (North-East-Down): x North, y East, z Down. z points
  DOWN → altitude = −z, gravity is +g along z.
- **State vectors are NumPy arrays.**
  - Point mass: `[x, y, z, vx, vy, vz]`
  - Rotation only: `[qw, qx, qy, qz, p, q, r]`
  - Rigid body: `[x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, qw, qx, qy, qz, p, q, r]` (13 elements) —
    position and velocity in NED, quaternion BODY → NED, angular rate in body axes.
- **Quaternions:** `[w, x, y, z]` (scalar first), Hamilton product, unit norm.
  `q` rotates vectors BODY → NED: `v_ned = to_matrix(q) @ v_body`.
- **Body axes:** x forward (nose), y right wing, z down. Angular velocity
  `omega = [p, q, r]` is expressed in body axes: p = roll rate (about x), q = pitch
  rate (about y), r = yaw rate (about z). With a diagonal inertia tensor the body
  axes are the principal axes, and "axis 1, 2, 3" means x, y, z. These are FRD axes
  (forward-right-down). Sources in FLU (Gazebo, ROS: x forward, y left, z up) are
  converted with `jinete.profiles.flu_to_frd` (flip y and z).
- **Reference point:** the body's position is its centre of mass, and the inertia
  tensor is expressed about the centre of mass in body axes.
- Euler angles (roll φ, pitch θ, yaw ψ, ZYX order) only for display/input —
  never as internal state (gimbal lock at θ = ±90°).
- **Environment models are callables** (plain functions or dataclasses with
  `__call__`), so any of them can be swapped or combined:
  - density: `altitude [m] -> rho [kg/m³]` (`DensityModel`)
  - wind: `(t [s], position NED [m]) -> wind velocity NED [m/s]` (`WindModel`)
  - these aliases, `GRAVITY` and the neutral defaults live in
    `core/environment.py`. `core` never imports `campo`; `campo` and `jinete` may
    import `core`.
  - models that only depend on height read the altitude as `-position[2]`.
- **Wind vector convention:** the NED wind vector points where the air goes TO.
  Weather reports give where it comes FROM, clockwise from north;
  `meteorological_wind(speed, direction_from_deg)` converts. An updraft has a
  negative down component.
- **Airspeed** is the velocity relative to the air, `v − wind`. Aerodynamic forces
  use airspeed; the state keeps the ground velocity. In body axes:
  `jinete.aero.body_airspeed(t, state, wind) = R(q)ᵀ (v − wind)`, components u
  (nose), v (right wing), w (down); w > 0 means positive angle of attack.
- **Vehicle profiles are data, not code.** Each vehicle is a frozen (immutable)
  parameter dataclass (e.g. `MultirotorParams`), one constant per vehicle in
  `jinete/profiles.py`, with a comment citing where every number comes from. Models
  never know which vehicle they fly. Fields are plain numbers that map 1:1 to the
  YAML files of phase 8. Controller gains will live next to the physical parameters
  of each profile, not inside them.
- **Vehicle interface:** a vehicle contains a `RigidBody` and hands it its own
  `force_moment` (vehicles do not subclass `RigidBody`). It exposes
  `derivative(t, state)` and is commanded through attributes that a controller sets
  in `pre_step` (multirotor: `rotor_speed_command`, one value per rotor [rad/s]).
- **Rotor spin:** `+1` = counter-clockwise seen from above (PX4/Gazebo "ccw"); the
  body reacts the other way, so a `+1` rotor yaws the body right (positive r).
- **Simulation step order:** `pre_step(t, y)` (controllers) → one RK4 step →
  `post_step(y)` (e.g. renormalise the quaternion) → `stop(t, y)`.
- **Controllers** are dataclasses with `update(...)`, run once per step from
  `pre_step`; the ones with memory (integrals) have `reset()`. Per-axis gains are
  3-vectors: `[roll, pitch, yaw]` for the rate and attitude loops, `[north, east,
  down]` for the velocity loop. Gains are expressed so that they do not depend on
  the vehicle (angular acceleration per rate error, rate per attitude error,
  acceleration per velocity error). All the gains of one vehicle live in a
  `MultirotorGains` next to its profile (`IRIS_GAINS`).
- **Autopilot interface:** `Autopilot(vehicle, gains, dt)` is a callable; pass it
  as `pre_step`. Whoever guides the vehicle sets `autopilot.velocity_command`
  (NED [m/s]) and `autopilot.yaw_command` ([rad]).
- Parameter classes validate their inputs in `__post_init__` and raise
  `ValueError` with a clear message. Inertia tensors go through
  `core.inertia.inertia_tensor` (symmetric, positive definite, triangle inequality)
  and are stored read-only.
- Use `zip(..., strict=True)` so sequences of different length fail loudly instead
  of being silently truncated (ruff B905).
- Dynamics expose `derivative(t, state) -> d(state)/dt`; integrators know nothing
  about physics.
- Type hints and docstrings on every public function.
- Every physics module ships with tests against known analytic results.
- Git: pull when starting, commit + push when finishing. Small commits, clear
  English messages.

Simulation flow: `atalaya` detects → `capitan` decides → `escuadron` coordinates →
each `jinete` flies using `core` inside the `campo`.

**The simulator never draws.** It produces data (states + events over time).
Visualisation is a separate layer that reads that data:

1. Now: matplotlib, for debugging and analysis plots.
2. Multi-drone scenarios: export to **CesiumJS** (CZML) for a web 3D globe with real
   terrain and satellite imagery — the showcase/demo view.
3. Optional: Godot real-time viewer.

## 5. Roadmap

| Phase | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Integrators (Euler, RK4) | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Point mass: gravity + drag, simulation loop | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Rotation: quaternions, Euler's equations | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Full 6-DOF rigid body | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Environment: ISA atmosphere, wind | ✅ Done |
| 6a | Quadrotor (Iris profile) + cascaded attitude/velocity control | ✅ Done |
| 7 | **End-to-end MVP:** one interceptor vs one target, simple guidance | 🔄 Next |
| 6b | Generic fixed-wing threat model (aero coefficient tables) | ⏳ after 7 |
| 8 | Scenarios in YAML, multiple entities | ⏳ |
| 9 | Sensors + Kalman filter | ⏳ |
| 10 | Guidance (proportional navigation) | ⏳ |
| 11 | Coordination strategies (assignment, comms) | ⏳ |
| 12 | Real terrain + Cesium visualisation | ⏳ |
| 13 | Monte Carlo analysis, final README, demo video | ⏳ |

Order: 6a → 7 → 6b → 8 … (integrate early: the MVP uses a scripted target, and the
fixed-wing model replaces it afterwards).

**Phase 6a — done**, in 8 steps (each with tests green, ruff clean, commit + push):
airspeed in body axes; rotors, mixer and Iris profile; multirotor force model;
`pre_step` hook (discrete control, zero-order hold); rate loop (PI); attitude loop
(quaternion error); velocity loop + `Autopilot` + example; this document.

**Phase 7 — end-to-end MVP.** The first time every layer works together, kept
deliberately small and ugly-but-honest:
- One interceptor (the phase 6a quadrotor, full 6-DOF in ISA + wind) against one
  target flying a simple path (straight line or gentle turn) as a scripted
  trajectory; the fixed-wing model of phase 6b replaces it afterwards.
- Perfect information (true target state, no sensors yet) and the simplest guidance
  that works (pure pursuit): `autopilot.velocity_command = v_max · unit(r_target −
  r_interceptor)`, recomputed every step from `pre_step`.
- Outputs: closest-approach (miss) distance and time, with the event time
  interpolated between steps (not just the first sample past it); a 3D plot of both
  trajectories; a pass/fail criterion (e.g. miss < 1 m).
- Goals: prove the architecture fits end to end before scaling up, find interface
  problems early, and produce the first figure for the README.
- Out of scope: YAML scenarios, sensors, proportional navigation, several agents —
  each later phase replaces one simplified piece of the MVP.

## 6. Decision log

- Python + NumPy for the engine; performance work only when profiling shows a need.
- RK4 fixed-step as the default integrator.
- NED frame from day one, to avoid a later refactor.
- Simulation decoupled from visualisation.
- Gravity is constant (9.80665 m/s²): its change with altitude is ~0.3 % at 10 km,
  far below the uncertainty in vehicle aero parameters.
- Air density varies with altitude (~10 %/km) and matters. Dynamics receive a
  density model `altitude -> rho` from outside; the full ISA model lives in `campo`
  (phase 5). Until then, constant sea-level density is the default.
- Aerodynamics are NOT computed from 3D geometry at runtime (that would be CFD).
  3D models are visual only. Each vehicle carries precomputed coefficient models
  (CD, CL, CY, Cl, Cm, Cn as functions of alpha, beta, Mach, control deflections),
  from published data, DATCOM, XFLR5/AVL or offline CFD. Runtime: airspeed in body
  axes (via quaternion) → alpha, beta → interpolate → forces/moments. Multirotors
  use per-axis body drag + linear rotor drag.
- Interceptor drones vs. ballistic projectiles is physically unrealistic; threats
  are drones and slow cruise missiles. Unwinnable engagements should be reported as
  such.
- Rigid-body state mixes frames on purpose: position and velocity in NED, angular
  rate in body axes. With NED velocity the translational equation has no Coriolis
  term (−ω × v_b), and each equation is written in the frame where it is natural.
  Airspeed in body axes (for alpha, beta) is obtained later as `Rᵀ(v − wind)`
  (phase 6).
- `RigidBody` takes a `force_moment(t, state) -> (F_body, M_body)` callback. Gravity
  is NOT part of it: the body adds it in NED. Any coupling between attitude and
  translation (thrust direction, aerodynamics) lives in that callback, never in
  `derivative()`. The callback receives the full state, so forces can depend on
  attitude and angular rate.
- RK4 does not preserve the quaternion norm. `simulation.run` has an optional
  `post_step(y) -> y` hook applied after every step; `rigid_body.normalize_attitude`
  renormalises the quaternion. Without it the norm drifts (~3e-3 after 100 s at
  dt = 0.1 and ω ≈ 5 rad/s; ~3e-8 at dt = 0.01).
- Decoupling is tested in vacuum only (zero force model): rotation alone does not
  change the centre-of-mass motion. In air it does (attitude changes alpha/beta and
  hence drag and lift); that effect belongs to the aerodynamic force model and gets
  its own test in phase 6.
- `RotatingBody` (attitude only) is kept next to `RigidBody` for now although both
  use the same Euler equations. Revisit in phase 6 (possible shared function).
- **ISA scope:** two layers, troposphere (0–11 km, −6.5 K/km) and isothermal layer
  (11–20 km). Altitude is treated as geopotential without conversion (difference
  ~0.17 % at 11 km). Above 20 km results are not valid and this is documented, not
  enforced: interceptor/threat scenarios stay far below. Below sea level the
  troposphere formulas simply continue.
- ISA keeps its own `STANDARD_GRAVITY` (same value as `GRAVITY`) on purpose: g0 is
  part of the ISA definition, not the gravity model of the simulator.
- Speed of sound is available (`isa_speed_of_sound`) so Mach can drive aero
  coefficient tables in phase 6.
- **Wind only acts through airspeed:** drag uses `v − wind`, the state keeps the
  ground velocity. A body released in wind drifts towards the wind velocity with a
  lag of the order of `v_terminal / g` (~1.8 s for the example body).
- `ProfileWind` interpolates NED components, not speed and direction, so a wind
  turning through north does not swing through south.
- `PowerLawWind` clamps the height to `[0, gradient_height]`: zero wind at and below
  the ground, constant above the gradient height. Exponent 0 gives a uniform wind
  (`0**0 = 1` in Python, covered by a test).
- `DiscreteGust` is the deterministic "1-cosine" gust, uniform in space (no gust
  front travelling across the field). `CombinedWind` sums any models.
- **Stochastic turbulence (Dryden/von Kármán) is deferred:** it needs a seeded
  random generator to keep runs reproducible for Monte Carlo, and it only matters
  once vehicles have control loops (phase 6+).
- **Vehicle parameters come from open sources:** published research platforms and
  airframes (e.g. open quadrotor datasets, PX4 SITL models, XFLR5/AVL analyses).
  Threats are generic, representative classes (e.g. "small fixed-wing loitering
  drone", "subsonic cruise-missile-like target") with plausible public-domain
  numbers, not reproductions of specific real weapons. The value of the project is
  the engagement and coordination analysis, not weapon data.
- Shared interfaces (`GRAVITY`, `DensityModel`, `WindModel`, `sea_level_density`,
  `no_wind`) moved from `point_mass.py` to `core/environment.py`, so `RigidBody`
  and `campo` no longer depend on the point-mass model. `point_mass` still imports
  them, so old imports keep working, but new code imports from `environment`.
- Physical validity is checked once, at construction: mass > 0, drag area ≥ 0,
  inertia symmetric + positive definite + triangle inequality (flat-plate equality
  allowed). The validated inertia is read-only because its inverse is cached; a
  silent in-place change would leave a stale inverse.
- An end-to-end MVP (phase 7) comes right after the first vehicle, before YAML
  scenarios and sensors: integrate early, then replace one simplified piece per
  phase.
- The README is filled in when there is something to show (phase 7 figure, phase 13
  final). Until then this document is the project log.

Phase 6a (quadrotor):
- **Phase 6 is split**: 6a quadrotor + control (needed by the MVP), then phase 7,
  then 6b fixed-wing. The MVP target is a scripted trajectory.
- **Discrete controllers with zero-order hold.** A PID has memory (its integral).
  `force_moment` is called 4 times per RK4 step at trial states, so a controller
  inside it would update its memory 4 times with states that are not real. Instead
  `run` calls `pre_step(t, y)` once per step; the controller sets the vehicle
  commands there and they stay constant for the whole step, as in a real autopilot.
  The rigid body stays pure and the state stays 13 elements (rejected alternative:
  appending the controller states to the state vector). For now the control rate is
  the simulation rate (1/dt); a wrapper can run a controller every N steps if needed.
- **Profiles separate from code** (see conventions). The first profile is the 3DR
  Iris of PX4 SITL (`iris.sdf.jinja`): open and well documented, used to validate
  the model. Its thrust-to-weight ratio is only 1.896 (max 7.07 N per rotor; hover
  at 3.73 N per rotor = 799 rad/s, 73 % of the 1100 rad/s maximum): enough for the
  MVP against a slow target, low for an interceptor. A more aggressive interceptor
  profile will be added later as data, with its own sources.
- Iris mass = base_link 1.5 kg + 4 × 0.005 kg rotors = 1.52 kg. Inertia = base_link
  only: the rotors would add 1–3 % (parallel-axis terms), below the uncertainty of
  the published values.
- **Mixer** built from the rotor positions and spins, not a hand-written X matrix
  (the Iris is not square: arms 0.13/0.22 m front, 0.13/0.20 m back). Allocation
  matrix rows: total thrust, roll `−y_i`, pitch `x_i`, yaw `spin_i · moment_constant`.
  Inverse with the pseudo-inverse (exact for 4 rotors, minimum effort for 6 or 8).
  Layouts with rank < 4 are rejected (e.g. all rotors spinning the same way cannot
  yaw). Rotor thrusts are clipped to `[0, T_max]`; when that happens the produced
  wrench differs from the requested one.
- **The vehicle input is the rotor speed** [rad/s], like an ESC command, clipped to
  `[0, Ω_max]`. Motors respond instantly: the Iris motor time constants (12.5 ms up,
  25 ms down) are not modelled.
- **Thrust, reaction torque and rotor drag scale with ρ/ρ_ref** (ρ_ref = 1.225 kg/m³):
  propeller theory gives `T = C_T ρ n² D⁴`, and the PX4 constants are sea-level
  values. At 3000 m the Iris has ~74 % of its sea-level thrust. With that factor
  the rotor drag grows like √ρ at constant thrust, the same law the PX4 EKF2 drag
  model uses.
- **Rotor drag** (Gazebo motor model form): at each hub,
  `−(ρ/ρ_ref) · c_rd · Ω_i · v_perp,i`, linear in airspeed, with v_perp the hub
  airspeed in the rotor plane including `ω × r_i`. Applied at the hub, so it pitches
  the nose up in forward flight (hubs 0.023 m above the CoM) and damps yaw rotation.
  `c_rd = 0.000175` from `iris.sdf`.
- **Body drag** (PX4 EKF2 drag model form): `−½ ρ CdA_i u_i |u|` per body axis
  (isotropic when the CdA are equal). The Gazebo Iris has no body drag; CdA =
  m / 100 kg/m² = 0.0152 m² from the default PX4 ballistic coefficient
  (`EKF2_BCOEF_X/Y`), a generic value not measured on the Iris. No open value for
  the vertical axis: same CdA as a placeholder.
- **Not modelled, on purpose:** the Gazebo thrust loss with axial airspeed
  (`1 − v/25`, it reduces thrust equally when climbing and descending, which is not
  physical), the Gazebo rolling moment (coefficient 1e-6, negligible) and the
  gyroscopic moments of the rotors.
- The in-air decoupling test pending since phase 4 is done: with the same ground
  velocity, a level quad feels rotor drag and a nose-up one (air along the rotor
  axis) does not.

Phase 6a (control):
- **Cascade** velocity → attitude → body rate → mixer → rotor speeds, each loop a
  discrete controller called from `pre_step`, each one slower than the loop it
  commands.
- **Rate loop: PI, no D.** It asks for an angular acceleration
  `α = kp·e + ki·∫e` and turns it into a moment `M = I·α + ω × Iω`; the second term
  cancels the gyroscopic coupling, so each axis is exactly `ω̇ = α`. With
  instantaneous motors the plant is first order and needs no D (PX4 uses one; it
  matters with motor lag and sensor noise). Anti-windup: the integral term is
  clamped. kp chosen here (PX4's are in its normalised mixer units and do not
  transfer): roll/pitch 20 1/s (τ = 50 ms), yaw 5 1/s (little yaw authority).
- **Rate-loop integral from the PX4 I/P ratios** (0.2/0.15 roll and pitch, 0.1/0.2
  yaw), which are unit-free and do transfer. The first choice, critical damping of
  the rate loop alone (`ki = kp²/4`), left a slow tail in the attitude response
  once cascaded: tuning a loop alone is not tuning it in the cascade.
- **Attitude error** `q_err = conj(q_cmd) ⊗ q`: the rotation from the commanded to
  the actual attitude, in body axes. Turned into a rotation vector the short way
  (flip q if w < 0: q and −q are the same attitude), and `ω_cmd = −kp·θ`, clipped to
  the rate limits. `kp_att = kp_rate / 4` makes the cascade critically damped when
  the rate loop is P only (natural frequency kp_rate/2). Values 5, 5, 1.25 1/s,
  same order as PX4 (`MC_ROLL_P` = 4.0, `MC_YAW_P` = 2.8, same units). Rate limits
  3.5 rad/s roll/pitch (PX4 220 deg/s), 1.5 rad/s yaw.
- **Velocity loop** with the PX4 default gains, which are in the same units
  (acceleration per velocity error): kp 1.8 / 1.8 / 4.0, ki 0.4 / 0.4 / 2.0, tilt
  limit 45 deg; PX4's D term is left out. Thrust vector `F = m(a − g)`; limits with
  the vertical part first (thrust range 10–90 % of the maximum, the rest of the
  horizontal part up to the tilt limit); attitude with body z against F and the
  nose towards the commanded heading (`quaternion.from_matrix`, Shepperd's method);
  total thrust = F projected on the *current* thrust axis (Lee/Mellinger), so a
  vehicle still turning does not push the wrong way and gives no thrust upside
  down.
- **Velocity integral limit 5 m/s²** (chosen): with 3 m/s² the integral saturated in
  a 10 m/s cruise (drag needs ~3.6 m/s²) and the speed stuck at 9.7 m/s. It also
  covers the ~3.4 m/s² lost at 3000 m.
- **The controllers do not know the air density.** They convert thrust to rotor
  speed at the reference density; the vertical integral absorbs the difference
  (tested at 3000 m).
- **Closed-loop tests compare with the exact discrete solution** where possible
  (P-only rate loop: `e_(k+1) = (1 − kp·dt) e_k`; P-only rate + attitude: a
  two-line recursion), not with the continuous one: with a zero-order hold the
  discrete solution is what the simulation must reproduce (to 1e-9 / 1e-6), and
  the continuous one differs by about 1 %.
- **Top speed of the model: 20.7 m/s (74 km/h)** at the 45 deg tilt limit (example).
  No published top speed of the Iris was found, so it is plausible but not
  validated. The PX4 SITL Iris weighs 1.52 kg; the real Iris+ is listed at
  1.282 kg (iFixit): the model is the SITL vehicle, not the retail one.

    (clipped), `rotor_speeds_for(thrusts)` (at the reference density).
  - `Multirotor(params, density=sea_level_density, wind=no_wind)`: holds
    `rotor_speed_command` (starts at zero) and a `RigidBody`; `derivative(t, state)`
    and `force_moment(t, state)` (thrust + reaction torques via the mixer, rotor
    drag, body drag; all in body axes).

  - `Autopilot(vehicle, gains, dt)`: callable `pre_step` hook with

- Tests (180 passing, ruff check + ruff format clean):
  - integrators (2); rotation (5) — as in phases 1–3.
  - rigid body (10): the 8 of phase 4 + rejects mass ≤ 0 (2 cases).
  - inertia (10): read-only copy, accepts lists and products of inertia, accepts
    the flat-plate limit, rejects non-physical tensors (not 3x3, asymmetric, zero
    or negative moment, triangle inequality broken — 5 cases), both bodies validate,
    body inertia cannot be changed in place.
  - point mass (13): vacuum parabola, terminal velocity, drag reduces range,
    thinner air increases range; rejects invalid mass / drag area (3 cases);
    moving with the wind feels no drag; drag depends on airspeed, not ground speed
    (headwind / still / tailwind — 3 cases); a falling body drifts to the wind
    velocity and keeps the same terminal fall speed; the wind model receives time
    and position.
  - atmosphere (12): standard ISA table at 0 / 5 / 11 / 20 km (T, p, rho, a —
    4 cases); −6.5 K/km lapse rate; constant temperature in the isothermal layer;
    pressure continuous at the tropopause; density decreasing with altitude;
    hydrostatic equilibrium `dp/dh = −rho·g0` by finite differences (3 altitudes);
    ISA density read at altitude = −z inside `PointMass`.
  - wind (37): FROM/TO convention (4 headings) and speed kept; constant wind
    (independence, returns a copy, validation); profile wind (table values, linear
    interpolation, end values, ignores time and horizontal position, components not
    angles, plugs into `PointMass`, validation); power law (reference speed,
    exponent, direction, zero at ground, constant above gradient height, exponent 0,
    4 invalid inputs); gust (zero outside, starts/ends at zero, peak in the middle,
    half at a quarter, symmetric, mean = half the peak, uniform in space,
    validation); combined wind (sum, empty = calm).
  - aero (8): body airspeed for level / yawed 90° / pitched 30° (angle of attack =
    pitch) / rolled 90° flight (4 cases); flying with the wind feels no air; hovering
    in a headwind; rotation keeps the airspeed magnitude (20 random attitudes,
    seeded); the wind model receives time and position.
  - multirotor (17): equal thrusts give pure lift (Iris is not square but balanced);
    single-rotor wrench signs; mixer round trip (20 random, seeded); roll command
    pushes harder on the left; yaw command speeds up the ccw rotors; clipping;
    rejects all-same-spin layouts, invalid rotors (2 cases) and non-positive
    constants (4 cases); profiles are immutable; FLU→FRD; Iris front-right rotor is
    at x > 0, y > 0, above the CoM; Iris thrust-to-weight 1.896.
  - multirotor dynamics (20): hover is an equilibrium (also over 10 s); motors off
    is free fall; 10 % more speed gives 1.21× thrust; speed command clipped (too
    fast, negative); thrust scales with ISA density (3000 m); mixer moments give
    `ω̇ = M/I` (roll, pitch, yaw — 3 cases); body drag quadratic; rotor drag linear;
    rotor drag ignores axial air; rotor drag pitches the nose up (lever arm
    0.023 m); yaw rate damped by rotor drag; wind acts through the airspeed;
    attitude changes the drag; rejects invalid drag parameters (4 cases); Iris body
    drag matches the PX4 ballistic coefficient.
  - simulation (5): `pre_step` called once per step with the start-of-step time and
    state; cannot alter the history; `None` changes nothing; the command is held
    during the step (u = t sampled → left Riemann sum `dt²·n(n−1)/2`, not `T²/2`);
    motors cut at 1 s → exact free-fall parabola afterwards.
  - control (10): P-only rate step is the exact discrete first order (3 axes);
    gyroscopic coupling cancelled; P only leaves the steady error `d/(I·kp)` under
    a disturbance moment; the integral removes it (critically damped PI); integral
    clamp and reset; rejects invalid gains (2 cases) and a non-positive period.
  - quaternion (11): conjugate is the inverse; rotation vector round trip (3
    angles); short way (350° → −10°); q and −q give the same vector; tiny angle;
    `from_matrix` round trip (100 random, seeded) and half turns (3 axes).
  - attitude control (7): `ω_cmd = −kp·θ`; error in body axes from the command;
    turns the short way; rate command clipped; rejects invalid gains; roll recovery
    matches the exact discrete cascade (1e-6) and the continuous critically damped
    response (1 %); combined 30°/−20° tilt with the real gains: tilt < 1° after
    0.6 s and < 0.3° after 1 s, heading < 0.5° after 2 s, no overshoot.
  - velocity control (13): hover asks for level and the weight; heading command;
    2 m/s² North pitches the nose down by atan(a/g); tilt limit keeps the vertical
    part; total thrust limit; thrust projected on the current axis (60° roll →
    half); no thrust upside down; rejects invalid gains (3 cases); 5 m/s step
    (behaviour: no overshoot, altitude within 0.5 m); holding still in a 10 m/s wind
    tilts into it by `atan(D/mg)` (1e-5 rad); at 3000 m the rotor speed settles at
    `Ω₀·√(ρ₀/ρ)` (0.1 %).
- Examples (all run, `python -m examples.<name>`):
  - `projectile_drag.py` — vacuum vs drag.
  - `density_comparison.py` — constant vs exponential vs ISA density (~1.7 km apogee:
    ISA and exponential agree within ~1 %).
  - `density_comparison_2.py` — low-drag shot to ~15 km plus log-scale density
    profiles; the ISA bends at the tropopause.
  - `dzhanibekov.py` — intermediate-axis instability.
  - `tumbling_projectile.py` — tumbling body in vacuum, centre of mass on the exact
    parabola (deviation ~1e-11 m).
  - `wind_comparison.py` — body dropped from 500 m: still air vs uniform wind vs
    veering shear profile (ground tracks).
  - `wind_gust.py` — power-law mean wind + 1-cosine gust: the body lags the wind.
  - `iris_velocity_step.py` — Iris under the autopilot: 10 m/s North, then stop
    (speed, pitch, rotor speeds, altitude), plus the top speed (20.7 m/s at 45°).
- Physics note (intermediate-axis instability, torque-free): spin Ω about the
  intermediate axis grows any tiny perturbation at rate
  `λ = Ω·sqrt((I2−I1)(I3−I2)/(I1·I3))`. The example perturbation (0.01 rad/s on p
  and r) is an arbitrary stand-in for real imperfections, not a physical constant.
  The flip time grows only with the logarithm of the perturbation size
  (~ln(10)/λ ≈ 2 s per 10× smaller for I = diag(1,2,3), Ω = 2); it shrinks with
  faster spin and larger λ. Exactly zero perturbation never flips. Spin about the
  smallest or largest axis is stable.
- Loose ends from phases 4–5, resolved: style (ruff clean, now with stricter
  rules), `run` docstring documents `stop` and `post_step`, input validation of
  `PointMass`, `RigidBody` and `RotatingBody` (`core/inertia.py`), shared
  interfaces moved to `core/environment.py`, `pyproject.toml` added.
- Still open, on purpose (each has its moment):
  1. After `stop` fires, the last sample overshoots the event (e.g. ~v·dt below
     ground). Event-time interpolation is part of phase 7 (miss distance).
  2. The ISA functions are scalar-only (`if` on the altitude, `math`). Vectorise
     with `np.where` only if profiling shows a need (Monte Carlo, many agents).
  3. `RotatingBody` and `RigidBody` still duplicate Euler's equations (inertia
     validation is already shared). Revisit when a vehicle needs attitude-only runs.
  4. `README.md` stays minimal until there is something to show: the first real
     version comes with the phase 7 MVP figure, the final one in phase 13.
  5. Mixer saturation is plain clipping. It already happens for an instant at every
     velocity step (one rotor at 0, another at the maximum). A smarter strategy
     (give up yaw before roll and pitch, as PX4 does) when it starts to matter.
  6. Motor dynamics (first-order lag, 12.5 ms up / 25 ms down on the Iris) not
     modelled. Add if the rate loop needs it (it would add one state per rotor).
  7. Body drag is the weakest number: generic PX4 ballistic coefficient, and a
     placeholder for the vertical axis. The resulting top speed (20.7 m/s at 45°)
     is plausible but not validated against any Iris measurement.
  8. Rotor effects left out: axial-inflow thrust loss, rolling moment, gyroscopic
     moments; rotor inertia (1–3 %) left out of the Iris inertia.
  9. Controllers run at the simulation rate (1/dt).
  10. An interceptor-class multirotor profile (higher thrust-to-weight), as data
      with open sources.
  11. No position loop: the velocity loop holds vertical speed, not altitude (the
      Iris climbs ~0.6 m during a 10 m/s cruise). Add one if a scenario needs to
      hold a point.
  12. The attitude loop treats the whole rotation vector with per-axis gains; PX4
      gives the tilt priority over yaw ("reduced attitude", `MC_YAW_WEIGHT`). Not
      needed so far (tilt recovers in ~0.6 s with heading errors present).
  13. With the slow PX4 horizontal integral, braking leaves a small velocity tail
      while the drag compensation unwinds (a few tenths of m/s for a few seconds).
      PX4 reduces this with feedforward from its trajectory generator.
- Next: phase 7, the end-to-end MVP (new chat: "Seguimos con Jineta, fase 7: MVP").
  Proposed steps:
  - A scripted target: a small class with the same kind of interface as a vehicle
    (state over time) flying a straight line or a gentle turn at constant speed.
  - Pure-pursuit guidance in `pre_step`: velocity command towards the target at the
    interceptor's chosen speed, both vehicles advanced by the same `run`.
  - Closest approach with the time interpolated inside the step (relative motion
    taken as straight within one step: minimise |r + v τ| for τ in [0, dt]); this
    also resolves loose end 1 for this use.
  - A runnable example with a 3D plot of both trajectories and a pass/fail line
    (e.g. miss < 1 m); the figure goes into the first real README.
  - Expect the Iris to be too slow against fast targets: that is a result, and the
    reason for the interceptor profile (loose end 10).

## 8. Working with Claude

- **Language:** replies in Spanish; code, comments and commits in English.
- **Teaching first:** explain every new concept (physics, maths or Python) before
  using it. The author writes or pastes the code, runs it locally and reports back.
  Visual explanations are welcome when a concept is hard to picture.
- **Small verified steps:** each step ends with tests passing (`pytest -v`) and a
  commit + push.
- **Accuracy:** Claude checks what it states against the real repo and by running
  the code (test counts, labels, numbers, behaviour) before handing it over. When
  something could not be verified, it says so.
- Claude's workspace cannot install packages from PyPI: it runs the tests with a
  minimal pytest stand-in (`parametrize` + `raises`) and ruff. The author's
  `pytest -v` is the reference. Claude never commits to the repo: it hands over
  complete files (or exact insertions), the author writes them, runs the checks and
  commits. When a change touches several places of one file, Claude gives the whole
  file: partial insertions were the source of the errors in phase 6a (a lost
  import, a missing block).
- **End of each phase:** update this document (roadmap, conventions, decision log,
  current state) and hand it over to be committed.
- **Session hygiene:** Claude must tell the author when to start a new chat —
  at the end of a phase block, or when the conversation is getting long enough that
  older details risk being lost. Before switching, make sure this document is up to
  date. A new chat starts inside the "Jineta" Project with:
  "Seguimos con Jineta, fase N: <topic>".
- If a chat stops or breaks mid-task, open a new one in the Project: the repo and
  this document are the source of truth, not the chat history.
